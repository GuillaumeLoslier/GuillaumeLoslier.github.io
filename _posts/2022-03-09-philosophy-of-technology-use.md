title: Philosophy of Technology Use
tag: philosophie
---
I spoke last Sunday with my friend Bilal about the book Digital Minimalism, and how I had created a table in which I tried to find alternatives to the social media apps I was using. We have to be careful in how we use these technologies as we often end up wasting a great amount of time distracted by them.

<table class="table-latitude">
<thead>
<tr>
<td>What I use</td>
<td>What I use it for</td>
<td>Side effects</td>
<td>Alternative medium or uses</td>
</tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
<tr>
<td>Facebook</td>
<td>
<p>Connect with friends to know what they're up to, especially people outside of Montreal.</p>
<p>Maintain weak ties for networking in the hope of getting a job.</p>
<p>Be aware of opportunities for dance (calls).</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Endless scroll.</p>
<p>Checking it too often.</p>
<p>Reading stranger's opinions about things I don't care about.</p>
</td>

<p>Call friend every week.</p>
<p>Go to an art event every month and talk to people.</p>
<p>Make business cards</p>
