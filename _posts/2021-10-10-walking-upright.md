|               	|     Human                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|     Other   mammals                                                                                                                      	|

|     Skull     	|     Foramen   magnum is at the bottom of the skull, to balance the head on top of a   vertical spine.                                                                                                             	|     Chimpanzees:   Foramen magnum is at the back of the skull to align the head with a vertical   spine.                                 	|
|     Spine     	|     Lumbar   lordosis orients our torso and head on top of our hips.                                                                                                                                              	|     Most   mammals have an horizontal or crescent-shaped arc. Before learning to walk,   babies also have a spine shaped this way.       	|
|     Pelvis    	|     Shorter   and stouter than chimpanzees, bowl-shaped, lesser gluteal muscles attached to   the side of the pelvis help with stability while walking.                                                           	|     Chimpanzees   have a tall, flat pelvis, that anchor lesser gluteals on the back, which   allow them to kick their legs backwards.    	|
|     Femur     	|     Femur has   a tilt, called the bicondylar angle.                                                                                                                                                              	|     Femur is   straight in newborns and chimpanzees. The downward pressure causes the end of   the growing femur to tilt.                	|
|     Foot      	|     Large   heels, rigid ankles, long Achilles tendon, and a long, stiff and arched sole   of the foot.     A non-grasping   toe in line with the other toes.The toe can bend upward as we push off the gound.    	|     An ape has   long toes that bend downward for grasping.                                                                              	|
