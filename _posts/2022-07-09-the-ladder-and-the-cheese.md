There is this myth in the dance world that dance mastery is a ladder that you climb. You learn this move, then you learn this move, and once you do all these moves well according to the other dancers, you're a dance master. That old-school way of thinking still permeates the dance world : festivals and dance schools, and dance companies. Maybe it comes from ballet, maybe it's something deeper than that, I don't know. But really, it's pretty obvious that dance is multi-faceted, and that knowledge in a dance form doesn't mean knowledge in the other. You could master dance forms, but not dance itself. You can become a versatile dancer that masters many forms, but you can never master them all, you will always have to make a choice in the type of dance training and dance movements you choose to do. That choice will speak about your values, the environment that you were brought in, the opportunities that you were given or not.<br>
Not having an education in ballet means that I was rejected from some opportunities in contemporary dance : dance schools, auditions, gigs, etc. But I did get accepted in a dance school, and did get some good professional gigs in the end, and I think that those rejections really enabled me to pursue a personal path, an experimental approach where I try different things that I find interesting instead of trying to fit in a mold.
This being said, I think there is value in going deeply into a form, and unraveling all the complexity hidden in apparent simplicity, or the simplicity in the complex, spending time on some movement forms, getting used to them, learning from them over time. Some people have learned a lot from these forms and can teach other people the way to learn them. They are teachers and deserve our respect for the work they do. Without them, the dance world would be very confusing. Does that mean that they are masters?<br>
It maybe is less of a mastery, which to me implies something about status, something finite, then a very long pursuit of knowledge where people are working at different places and paces in different dance forms. I was listening to Barry Mazur, a mathematician, talk about what one of his teachers said : 
"We're all little mice nibbling on the infinite cheese of knowledge. We're never going to consume the cheese, but it's the love of doing it together, and how it shapes us, that's important.Â "
