According to fitness guru Ido Portal, we, as humans, are generalists. We were made to swim, run, crawl, but are increasingly being forced to sit down and diminish the variety of our physical experiences. It is a bit of a sweeping statement, as we are certainly specialized in some ways, as evolutionary scientist Eldredge points out.

>Modern humans are curious mixtures of specialists and generalists. We are "specialized" in relatively few features, but they are critical: our hands have opposable thumbs for manipulation; we are bipedal. And in conjunction with our specialized stereoscopic vision and mental powers, we have enormous capabilities: culture has become our basic adaptive approach to the environment, easily transcending our primitive heritage as simple hunter-gatherers. Physically, we otherwise remain rather generalized; we are, for example, omnivores. And it turns out, almost ironically, our culture is an evolutionary specialization which conveys tremendous flexibility when approaching the environment: our evolutionary specializations actually enhance our ecological generality.

But what is the evolutionary advantage of being a specialist or a generalist for a species like ours?

>Further, the more specialized a species is, the less likely that it will be able to continue to recognize suitable habitat as conditions change. Most vulnerable are species focusing on single food sources. Parasites often have only a single host species- which is fine, so long as the host survives. Taking advantage of an abundant single resource makes good ecological and evolutionary "sense". But such a strategy is effective only as long as that resource remains available. The trade-off is vulnerability to extinction, and it is a simple fact of nature that ecologically specialized species become extinct at much higher rates than do ecologically generalized species. There is a balance here: natural selection will tend to produce ecologically specialized organisms, as often they will flourish more than generalists in the short run. But extinction keeps pruning back the ranks of the specialists. In the long run, the generalists hang on, while the ranks of the specialists are rapidly replenished by the continual evolution of new species.
